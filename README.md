# Taxi Trip Duration Prediction
New York City experiences high taxi demand and dynamic traffic conditions, making travel duration difficult to estimate accurately. Develop a machine learning system that can estimate taxi trip duration before the journey starts to support operational decision making.

 # NYC Taxi Trip Duration Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict the duration of New York City taxi trips using machine learning techniques. The prediction system was developed to support transportation decision-making, route planning, and operational efficiency.

The final model uses XGBoost and is deployed through FastAPI and Streamlit to provide an interactive prediction dashboard.

## Objectives

- Predict taxi trip duration before the trip starts.
- Support transportation operational efficiency.
- Build an end-to-end machine learning project from data understanding to deployment.
- Develop an interactive dashboard for users.

## Dashboard Features

The dashboard provides:

- Taxi trip duration prediction
- Estimated arrival time
- Traffic condition indicator
- Operational recommendations

---

## Key Insights

- Trip distance is the most influential feature in predicting trip duration.
- Time-related features (pickup hour, day of week, weekend) improve prediction performance.
- Using only features available before the trip starts makes the model more realistic and prevents data leakage.
- XGBoost provides a good balance between predictive performance and computational efficiency.
